# funWithSolvers
Starting with a Sudoku solver I try to implement solvers for commonly known riddles

## Solvers I plan on including here
- Sudoku
- Kakuro
- Shikaku
- SumSum
- Picross

## What else can I do with this once I'm done with these puzzles
- Write puzzle generators and thus an enjoyable little program for leisure activities
